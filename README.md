# Laravel Nova 4 Signature

This [Nova](https://nova.laravel.com/) field lets you save a signature as a field for your resource.
It's based on the work of [lab404/nova-signature](https://packagist.org/packages/lab404/nova-signature) that works only with Nova 3 as fare as I know.

Behind the scenes [WangShayne/vue3-signature](https://github.com/WangShayne/vue3-signature) is used.

Note that vue3-signature doesn't expose all signature pad components so to get it working with our component it was required to patch library to propagate "begin" and "end" event to parent component as I was unable to use a watcher as in the previous version [WangShayne/vue3-signature](https://github.com/WangShayne/vue3-signature).

Here our patched fork [operativeit/vue3-signature](https://github.com/operativeit/vue3-signature).

## Installation

`composer require eom-plus/nova-signature`

## Usage

In your nova resource make the field `EomPlus\NovaSignature\Signature`.
This field fits perfectly with a `TEXT` column as it store data in base64 format and can be used both for resources and actions.

```php
use EomPlus\NovaSignature\Signature;

// ...

public function fields()
{
    return [
        // ...
        Signature::make('Signature'),
        // ...
    ];
}
```

## Configuration

Showed example values are the default ones.

```php
Signature::make('Signature')
    ->color('black') // (string) Any css compatible value: "red", "rgb(0, 0, 0)", ...
    ->bgColor('white') // (string) Same as 'color'
    ->width('100%') // (string) Any css compatible value: "100%", "200px", ...
    ->height('250px') // (string) Same as 'width'
    ->asSvg() // Save image as SVG format, you can use asJpg() to save as JPEG instead. By default format is PNG.
```

### Validation

You can use the `signature` validation rules to check if the signature is valid.
We also provide the `validSignature` method that adds `nullable` and `signature` rules.

```php
// With validSignature() 
Signature::make('Signature')
    ->validSignature() // 'nullable' and 'signature' rules

// Your own rules
Signature::make('Signature')
    ->rules('signature', ...) 
```
### Translations

Currenlty we have include  french, spanish and english translations.
If you want to add more language you publish  translations with the following command

```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider=EomPlus\NovaSignature\FieldServiceProvider --tags=translations
```

If you add more languages don't hesitate to send us a PR.
